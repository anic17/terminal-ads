# terminal-ads  
The worst idea ever: banner ads in your terminal  

## About  
Ever felt like your terminal was too clean? No popups, no flashing banners, no annoying interruptions like the Web in 2025? **Time to fix that.**  

**terminal-ads** is a proof-of-concept that brings the horrors of modern advertising to the only place that was still safe and ad-free: **your terminal.** This Windows program ensures that persistent, intrusive, useless and distracting banners are always displayed at the top of your terminal window. Fortunately, there is no Linux version yet so you're safe over there (for now).

Because why should terminals be an exception to the rest of the modern world?  

## Features  
- 📌 **Persistent Banner Ads**: Always at the top, whether you scroll or clear the screen.  
- 🚫 **Unskippable**: The ads stay there for the entire terminal. Forever.
- ⚙️ **Customizable Ad Intrusiveness**: Ability to choose how much suffering you want
- 🤡 **Completely Unnecessary**: It's not a big surprise.  

## Why?  
Because every space should be monetized. And also, because nobody asked for this.  

## Usage

`ads [1 | 2 | 3 | 4]`
The different numbers indicate the level of intrusiveness:
- **Free tier (1)**
  - Persistent ads displayed every 0.5 seconds when the screen is cleared
  - Console title changes to the text displayed on the banner
- **Basic tier (2)**
  - Persistent ads displayed every second when the screen is cleared
- **Premium tier (3)**
  - Inserts an intrusive ad once, no persistence, no flashing colors.
- **Premium+ tier (4)**
  - Recommended option: doesn't insert junk into your terminal, and does absolutely nothing.

## Installation

You really shouldn't use this anywhere. But if you really want to, here are the steps.

1. Clone this abomination:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/anic17/terminal-ads.git  
   cd terminal-ads
   ```
2. Build it with your Windows compiler.

3. Run it. And regret it.
